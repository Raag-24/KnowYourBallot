## Abstract

KnowYourBallot is a web platform designed to empower first-time voters by providing comprehensive information about candidates contesting in elections at both state and central levels.  Users can easily search for their specific constituency to access detailed candidate profiles, including past performance, policy positions, and relevant biographical details, all presented in an accessible format.  Beyond candidate information, the platform offers valuable resources on voter and candidate rights, ensuring both parties are well-informed about the electoral process.  To further empower voters, the platform integrates the latest election news, keeping users up-to-date on important developments.  Crucially, it provides direct contact information for the Chief Electoral Officer and polling booth officers for all booths within a given constituency, facilitating direct communication and issue resolution. This centralized resource aims to bridge the information gap, encourage active civic engagement among new voters, and strengthen the democratic process by facilitating informed participation.
